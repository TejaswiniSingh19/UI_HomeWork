CSS

Inline CSS    : we provide style attribute and all style sheets in that
Internal CSS  : we use style element for all style sheets
External CSS  : we try to have link element and with in that we try to provide css in seperate .css file

Good Practices of CSS : External is good practice( program is precise, we can change the styling of entire website without disturbing existing html program, more readable)
