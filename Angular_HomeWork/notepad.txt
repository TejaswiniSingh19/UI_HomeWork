1) One way data binding & two way data binding
Ans : 
One way data binding : In one way data binding we cannot update data from view. These systems can bind the data only in one direction.

Two way data binding : It is the synchronization between the model and the view. When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the view changes, the model is updated as well.


2) ng-init, ng-model, ng-app, ng-bind 
Ans :
ng-init   : It starts the angular application
ng-model  : It binds the input fields to the controller properties. It defines the model that is variable to be 			used in AngularJS
ng-app    : It initalizes the application data. It defines the root element. It will also load the AngularJS 				modules in angular application
ng-bind   : It binds the content of an html element to application data.



3) {{}}  angular expressions
Ans :
This is used instead of ng-bind to bind the data
